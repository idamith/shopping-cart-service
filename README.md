# Problem: Shopping Cart Microservice

- Imagine you are working on a shopping Cart component, when user choose a product, it will be published to a message queue.

- You are developing a micro service component which receives message from message queue, save it into database. You can use embedded database/jms for illustration purpose.

The code should:

1. Should have good test coverage.
2. The app should not lose message if the database connections goes down.
3. The app should be able to auto create table if the table doesnâ€™t exist in database.
4. Self-healing from database issue without human intervention.
5. Good fault tolerate.

# Solution

## Setup and run

`clone https://github.com/idotrick/shopping-cart-service.git`

Import shopping-cart-service project to IDE

OR

`cd shopping-cart-service` and `mvn compile`

Run as a conventional **SpringBoot** application though IDE or command line.

`java -jar target/shopping-cart-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` <br>
`java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=standalone target/shopping-cart-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Profiles

For demonstration purpose, following profiles are configured. Default profile is configured for demonstration of
embedded ActiveMQ broker.

- Default - Embedded ActiveMQ message broker & embedded H2 DB
- standalone - Standalone ActiveMQ message broker & embedded H2 DB

Activate relevant profile through JVM argument `spring.profiles.active=standalone`

## Solution features

### -  Good Test coverage.

### -  The app does't lose message if the database connections goes down

JMS Broker **ActiveMQ** ensures delivery of messages regardless the consistency of database connection. If any
exception occurred inside the listener message will not be acknowledged and redeliver to the client again. If the
message is unable to be persisted configured number of times, it will move to a **Dead Queue** in the ActiveMQ. That
message will be persisted for further manual inquiries.

> Refer to the listener implementation ***ItemSelectMessageReceiveService.java***<br>
> maximumRedeliveries are configurable as demonstrated in ***application-standalone.properties***     

### -  The app is able to auto create table if the table doesn't exist in database

Application uses JPA and default spring-hibernate configuration therefore it doesn't expect a schema to be existed. 
While app generates schema on startup if doesn't exist it also loads test data with the help of ***data.sql***.

### - Self-healing from database issue without human intervention

No human intervention is required for database. In production database shall be run in a cluster for better availability 
and scalability.

### - Good fault tolerate

Several replicas/nodes of this microservice shall be configured to run in production with the support of orchestration 
tools such as DockerSwarm or Kubernetes. In a failure of one or more nodes still the system is capable of running.
Because of the usage of ***Message Queue*** messages will be processed consistently when a node becomes available.
